# Readme for lab3 Jupyter Notebook
Title: "Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation, and Instance Segmentation"

### Description
This notebook provides a comprehensive guide for implementing and evaluating deep learning models for object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation tasks. It utilizes libraries such as Detectron2, PyTorch, and torchvision.

### Setup and Installation
- Ensure you have a GPU environment (e.g., Google Colab).
- Install necessary libraries:
  - GPUtil, psutil, humanize for monitoring memory and GPU usage.
  - PyTorch, torchvision, torchaudio, and specific CUDA and Detectron2 versions for deep learning tasks.
  - Other common libraries like Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, etc.

### Structure
1. **Initialization and Configuration:**
   - Set up the environment and dependencies.
   - Ensure GPU availability.
   - Mount Google Drive for data access.

2. **Part 1: Object Detection**
   - Data Loader: Load and preprocess data for object detection.
   - Model Configuration: Set up the model using Detectron2.
   - Training: Train the model for object detection.
   - Evaluation and Visualization: Evaluate the trained model and visualize the results.

3. **Part 2: Semantic Segmentation**
   - Data Loader: Load and preprocess data for semantic segmentation.
   - Network: Define and initialize the segmentation model.
   - Training: Train the segmentation model.
   - Evaluation and Visualization: Evaluate and visualize segmentation results.

4. **Part 3: Instance Segmentation**
   - Combine object detection and semantic segmentation models to perform instance segmentation.
   - Visualize and evaluate instance segmentation results.
   - Prepare data for submission (e.g., Kaggle competition).

5. **Part 4: Mask R-CNN**
   - Apply Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation.
   - Train, evaluate, and visualize Mask R-CNN model results.

### Data
- Data should be organized in Google Drive with specific folders for training, testing, and JSON annotations.
- Update the `BASE_DIR` variable to point to the correct directory.

### Execution
- Run cells sequentially, ensuring each part is correctly executed before proceeding.
- Some cells require manual input (e.g., setting paths, choosing hyperparameters).

### Improvements
- The notebook allows for improvements and experimentation, such as hyperparameter tuning or model architecture changes.

### Notes
- Make sure to have a stable internet connection when running on a cloud platform like Google Colab.
- Monitor GPU usage to avoid exceeding limits on platforms like Google Colab.

### Additional Requirements
- Familiarity with Python, PyTorch, and deep learning concepts is necessary to effectively use this notebook.
- Google Colab or an environment with GPU support is recommended for efficient training and evaluation.
